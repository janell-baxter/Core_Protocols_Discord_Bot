# Core Protocols Discord Bot
Structured use of the [Core Protocols](https://mccarthyshow.com/the-core/) in Discord.

## Why
The Core is a set of best practices culled from over 25 years of research from [Jim](https://twitter.com/mccarthyjim1) and [Michele](https://twitter.com/michmccarthy) McCarthy and the teams they have worked with. It includes commitments that are an agreement from the team to create a high functioning environment, and to accept the responsibility to maintain it. A set of Core Protocols help the team better understand and support the Core Commitments.

Communication and collaboration are improved when team members have a shared understanding of terms and responsibilities; people know what's expected of them. For example, using The Core, everyone understands that when someone **Checks In** that they are agreeing to a [set of commitments](https://greatness.rocks/the-core/) for high-functioning team work.

To use the Core Protocols, read the book [Software For Your Head](https://liveingreatness.com/software-for-your-head-book/). It's online, free, and covers the protocols in depth.

## How

# Project 

## Discord Bot Creation
You can create your own bot by following [Discord's Getting Started guide](https://discord.com/developers/docs/getting-started). If you don't have a server, you can use [Glitch](glitch.com) for development and short-term testing. 

## Project structure
This is an open source project built using the [example](https://github.com/discord/discord-example-app) provided by [Shay DeWael](https://github.com/shaydewael) as a starting point.

Below is a basic overview of the project structure:

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env -> .env file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.js      -> main entrypoint for app
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ commands.js -> slash command payloads + helpers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils.js    -> utility functions and enums
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
```
## Core Protocols Code
The Core Protocols functionality can be updated in the app.js, commands.js, and utils.js files.

### Check-In Emoji
The emoji for Check-In can be updated in utils.js.
```
export function getCheckinEmoji() {
  const emojiList = "üò° üò≠ üòÑ üò®";
  return emojiList;
}
```
### Command Descriptions
The descriptions for protocols are located in commands.js.
Example:
```
// -----------------------------------
// Core Protocols
// -----------------------------------
export const DECIDER_COMMAND = {
  name: "decider",
  description: "Decider: Immediately and unanimously move your team towards results",
  type: 1,
};
```
### Functionality
To change how the protocols work, see the apps.js file.

Example:
```
// -----------------------------------
// Handle modal submissions
// -----------------------------------
  if (type === InteractionType.APPLICATION_MODAL_SUBMIT) {
    // custom_id of modal
    const modalId = data.custom_id;
    // user ID of member who filled out modal
    const userId = req.body.member.user.id;

    if (modalId === "decider_proposal") {
      let proposal_text = "";
       for (let action of data.components) {
        let inputComponent = action.components[0];
        proposal_text += `${inputComponent.value}\n`;
      }
      return res.send({
        type: InteractionResponseType.CHANNEL_MESSAGE_WITH_SOURCE,
        data: {
          content: `@here <@${userId}> has initiated a Decider. Respond with üëç thumbs up or üëé thumbs down.\n\n<@${userId}> proposes ${proposal_text}`,
        },
      });
    }
  }
});
```
